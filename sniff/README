HexInject v.1.2

HexInject is a very versatile packet injector and sniffer,
that provide a command-line framework for raw network access.

It's designed to work together with others command-line utilities,
and for this reason it facilitates the creation of powerful shell scripts
capable of reading, intercepting and modifying network traffic in a transparent manner.

It can also convert hexadecimal traffic in raw binary traffic, and it has function
to disassemble and pretty print captured packets.
